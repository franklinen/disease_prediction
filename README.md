# Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Executive Summary
This project serves as the final unit of the University of Toronto DSI Machine Learning Certificate Diploma. All contributors are visible within the repository. 

Our project leverages [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning) to implement machine learning solutions aimed at clustering patients based on their symptoms, as well as determining symptoms that are the most important predictors for disease diagnosis.

This summary will be updated with results as the project progressess. 


## Problem Statement
Healthcare providers often struggle to quickly diagnose diseases due to a wide range of possible symptoms, as well as their variability accross patients. Traditional diagnosis methods are slow, error prone, and subject to human bias. This, in combination with the problems faced by Ontario's healthcare system indicates a need for systems capable of diagnosing patients based on the similarity and frequency of their symptoms. Such a system would assist medical professionals in client care, decrease misdiagnoses, and improve overall patient outcomes. 


## Project Goals
1. **Patient Clustering**: Train models to accurately determine client diagnosis by clustering based on symptom similarity.  
2. **Symptom Significance**: By examining the models created, we hope to determine the symptoms most indicative of a specific diagnosis. 
3. **Providing Actionable Insights**: Use the models to guide decision making, improve clinical workflows, and support evidence-based practices in patient care.
